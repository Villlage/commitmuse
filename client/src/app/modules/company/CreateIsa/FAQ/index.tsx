        <p>
          Income Share Agreements (ISAs) relieve the upfront financial burden of a student. The educator agrees to a
          contract where the student does not pay tuition until they secure a salary. Then, a fixed percentage of their
          income is paid to the educator via the app for a fixed duration. It is not a traditional loan or grant, and
          there is no principal balance or interest rate.

    title: 'Am I allowed to cancel the ISA?',
    content: (
      <p>
        There is an allotted cancellation period that the student is allowed to utilize in the case that they choose to
        cancel the contract. After that allotment, the contract can only be cancelled if the educator agrees to it.

      <p>
        Commit Muse will validate the studentâ€™s bank account as well as verify their income and taxes before the ISA is
        complete. Therefore, they will not be able to hide or skip payments.

      <p>
        There is always a possibility of bad actors even if we take every precaution against them. In this case, we have
        collection agencies who will ensure the money reaches the educator. For any further concerns, we would be happy
        to talk!
